# Notes

- For the first thing that I'm wanting to do, which is just show the top runs
for the week, I'll need to:
  - look up the current period
  - look up all the realms
  - look up the leaderboards for each realm 
  - look up each dungeon leaderboard for the realm 
- Also I'm going to need to look up all the classes and specs and just have
them in a table so I don't have to keep going back to check
